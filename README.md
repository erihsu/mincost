# MinCost
A collection of modern heuristic optimization framework designed to easily embed into your Rust project.

## Overwiew

1. Genetic Algorithm

2. Simulated Annealing

3. Particle Swarm

4. Tabu Search(TODO)


## Features

* Easy to Embed

  This is the primary design goal of mincost. See how to embed generic algorithm into your Rust project, please refer to [examples](examples/ga_examples)

* Various way to encoding your solution

  In mincost, you can encode your solution with various way. ie, in i8, i16, i32 and even boolean.

* Initialize solution by custom randness

  The solution can be initialized by your custom randomization strategy by closure. Refer to [examples](examples/ga_examples)
