# MinCost
A collection of modern heuristic optimization toolkit.

## Overwiew

1. Genetic Algorithm

2. Simulated Annealing

3. Particle Swarm

4. Tabu Search(TODO)


## Features

* Easy to embed

  This is the primary design goal of mincost. See how to embed genetic algorithm into your Rust project, please refer to [examples](examples/ga_examples)

* Flexiable encoding style

  In mincost, you can encode your solution with various style. ie, in i32, i16, i8 and even boolean.

* Initialize solution by custom randness

  The solution can be initialized by your custom randomization strategy by closure. Refer to [examples](examples/ga_examples)
